    "description": "Designed a modular deep-learning pipeline to reverse-engineer face-swap deepfakes, identifying the original source image with 85%+ accuracy on a custom dataset of 10,000+ manipulated images. Implemented convolutional architectures with feature extraction layers, enabling component-level model swapping for improved scalability. Addressed a real-world AI safety problem by going beyond detection to trace the origins of manipulation.",
